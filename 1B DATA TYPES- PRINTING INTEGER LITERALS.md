# Experiment No: 1B- Data Types â€“ Printing Complex Number.

## AIM  
Write a python program to read two numbers and convert and print them into a complex number.
## ALGORITHM  
**Step 1:** Start  
**Step 2:** Read an integer and store it in variable `a` (real part)  
**Step 3:** Read another integer and store it in variable `b` (imaginary part)  
**Step 4:** Create a complex number `c` using `a` and `b`  
**Step 5:** Print the complex number `c`  
**Step 6:** End

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212222050042
# Name-Nikkesh V

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=complex(a,b)
print(c)
