# Experiment No: 1e â€“ SEB-Maximum of Three Numbers

## AIM  
To write a Python program to find the maximum between three integer numbers using a conditional expression (Ternary operator).

## ALGORITHM  

**Step 1:** Begin the program  
**Step 2:** Read three numbers: `num1`, `num2`, and `num3`  
**Step 3:** Compare the three numbers to find the maximum:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `num1` is greater than or equal to both `num2` and `num3`, then `num1` is the maximum  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Else if `num2` is greater than or equal to both `num1` and `num3`, then `num2` is the maximum  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Else, `num3` is the maximum  
**Step 4:** Print the maximum value in the format:  

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212222050042
# Name-Nikkesh V
# Write your code here

num1 = int(input())
num2 = int(input())
num3 = int(input())

min_num = num1 if (num1 <= num2 and num1 <= num3) else num2 if (num2 <= num1 and num2 <= num3) else num3

print(f"The maximum of {num1}, {num2}, {num3} is {min_num}")
```
